# Projects_completed
These are the codess of my projects I have been completed and they are the proof of my work which I listed in CV. This repository contains the architecture notes, block diagrams, and design explanation for my RISC-V single-cycle CPU implementation.
The original Verilog source files were built and tested on Linux Mint using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave, but the system was corrupted during a disk issue, and the HDL files could not be recovered.

I am rebuilding parts of the project and will upload new HDL modules as they are recreated.
Until then, this repository includes: The code of all other projects of mine and the notes of the RISC V I used to create it
