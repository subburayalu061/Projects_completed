These are the completed project codes I have built across my VLSI, AI hardware, DSP, and digital design work. All source files, RTL implementations, and testbenches for my projects are included in this repository except the RISC-V Single-Cycle CPU, whose HDL files were lost during a Linux Mint system corruption.

The original RISC-V processor was fully implemented and tested using Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, and Linux Mint, but the HDL files could not be recovered after the disk failure.
To maintain transparency and as proof of the work I completed, I have created a dedicated branch containing all the architecture notes, block diagrams, pipeline sketches, and module planning documents I used during the design process.

📌 RISC-V Branch (Design Notes & Proof of Work):
RISC V branch — includes all handwritten notes, design explanations, diagrams, and planning files used to build the CPU.

I am currently rebuilding the RISC-V HDL modules from scratch, and the recreated Verilog files will be uploaded as soon as each module is completed.

Until then, this repository includes all the other completed projects, including:

64×64 Systolic Array AI Accelerator (full RTL + testbenches)

CSD-Based Adaptive FIR Filter System (RTL + error blocks + convergence tests)

DSP building blocks and experimental hardware modules

Verification environments and waveforms

Architecture notes and documentation
